/*
 *  Need to be Fixed:
 *  map builder can be more efficient "when picking rooms, choose rooms that are suitable" - BrandEn
 *      - in level.cpp
 *  Need to change to window so that the focus is on the window and not each individual scene
 *      - example: the scene is getting built as the room only. We want the scene to include all "widgets in the window
