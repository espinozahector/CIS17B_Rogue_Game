# CIS17B_Rogue_Game
RCC Fall 2016 
* Progress
  - We made a randomized map builder
      - Each "1" is a room
      - Each "0" is emptiness
  - Please give us input on how to improve/change the map if need be
  - Also, voice concerns or comments!
* To-Do
  - More efficient level generator
    - maybe building 3 - 4 rooms at a time
  - Create "Boss Room" -> just label it for now
  - Create room generator -> doors are important
  - Start builidng a connection where a player can move on the map
