# CIS17B_Rogue_Game
RCC Fall 2016 
* Progress
  - We made a randomized map builder
      - Each "1" is a room
      - Each "0" is emptiness
  - There are still bound issues, but sinces it's late, we are stopping. --fixed--
      - We = Victor + Hector
  - Please give us input on how to improve/change the map if need be
  - Also, voice concerns or comments!
