* RCC Fall 2016 
* Ideas
  - Predefined rooms, randomly put together each game
  - diablo-esq loot
  - loot drop locations are static, loot is random
  - 3 classic classes (loot based on class choice)
  - muliplayer networked, co-op
  - top down 2d
  - track score(levels cleared, mobs killed, etc)
  - permanent death
  - difficult as rooms progress
  - as player increases in level. enemies grow in difficulty
  - equipment slots (no inventory)
  - loot
