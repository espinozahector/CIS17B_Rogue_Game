- We set up a server that will operate off a computer. What is cool is that we will be connecting a chat.
  - It's a small network feat but it's huge! (was able to change a color of a label on the other person's computer)
    - for the server, we sent the color back to the initial person's computer to say that they are connected to the server
  - You MUST open the port 5045 in your router settings. If you need help with this, let one of us know.
