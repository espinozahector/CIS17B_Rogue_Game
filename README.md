# CIS17B_Rogue_Game
* RCC Fall 2016 
* Ideas
  - Predefined rooms, randomly put together each game.
    - loot drop locations are static, loot is random.
    - or - Randomly generate rooms. X*Y size and place objects randomly at (x,y).
    - Could mix the two styles.
  - diablo-esque loot.
  - 3 classic classes (loot based on class choice)
  - muliplayer networked, co-op
  - top down 2d
  - track score(levels cleared, mobs killed, etc)
    - How? total points? points per level and kill? per pick up/loot?
  - permanent death
  - difficulty increases as rooms/floors progress
  - as player increases in level. enemies grow in difficulty
    - How is player level increasing?
      - loot? kills? level completion? experience points?
      - Does it tie in with score tracking?
    - What increases automatically as players gain levels? (this is a great question!)
      - Character stats?
      - Hit points?
      - Damage multiplier?
  - equipment slots (no inventory)
    - Different equipment slots for each class?
  - loot
  
*Questions that need answering*
- Real-time or Turn-based?
  - real-time
- Grid based movement or free move?
  - free move
- Art style/source?
  - Sprite-based assuming 2D. Who is making sprites or should we find a free to use tileset?

*Let's just throw all title propositions Here*
  - Character classes
    - Warrior                   (High melee damage, high armor/HP)
    - Wizard                    (High ranged damage, low armor/hp)
    - Rogue/Ranger/Scoundrel?   (Medium melee/ranged damage, medium armor/hp)
  - Game Titles
