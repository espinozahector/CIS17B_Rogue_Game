# CIS17B_Rogue_Game
* RCC Fall 2016
* Due before 10/19/16 
  - <b>responsibilities, who is in charge of what, what is done, what needs to be done. Need to have menu and interfaces.</b>
  - If I add something that is already complete, add a note at the end of the objective that is complete. -- Do NOT delete it --
  - Also, please add anything I missed to the bottom of this README.md file. One of use will sort it in. We just want to make sure everything we put in is a valid objective (we are not trying to undermine anyone. we just want to have people focus valuable time on concrete/set ideas) --
  
* Character Objectives
  - Completed Inventory slots
  - All Equipment types (even include more than we expect to use)
  - Attack functions (regular, special, etc...)
  - Player and Enemy instanciations
  - Player stats (random vs prefab)
  - At least 5 different types of enemies to this point
    - All unique enemy-type stats
  - Full player leveling (I want to kill an enemy or two and level up my character right now. super simple battle system will suffice)

* Map Objectives
  - Room Builder (unique vs random)
  - Lootable objects (rocks, chests, etc...)
  - Do we need to convert the map to a template?
  - Level manouverability (ease of moving between rooms, not in rooms)
