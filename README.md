# CIS17B_Rogue_Game
* RCC Fall 2016 
* Ideas
  - Predefined rooms, randomly put together each game
    - or - Randomly generate rooms. X*Y size and place objects randomly at (x,y).
  - diablo-esq loot
  - loot drop locations are static, loot is random
  - 3 classic classes (loot based on class choice)
    - Warrior, Wizard, Ranger/Rogue types? If multiplayer, do we add Cleric as a fourth class?
  - muliplayer networked, co-op
  - top down 2d
  - track score(levels cleared, mobs killed, etc)
    - How? total points? points per level and kill? per pick up/loot?
  - permanent death
  - difficulty increases as rooms/floors progress
  - as player increases in level. enemies grow in difficulty
    - How is player level increasing?
      - loot? kills? level completion? experience points?
      - Does it tie in with score tracking?
    - What increases automatically as players gain levels? (this is a great question!)
      - Character stats?
      - Hit points?
      - Damage multiplier?
  - equipment slots (no inventory)
    - Different equipment slots for each class?
  - loot
