# CIS17B_Rogue_Game
* RCC Fall 2016 
* Ideas
  - Predefined rooms, randomly put together each game
    - or - Randomly generate rooms. X*Y size and place objects randomly at (x,y).
  - diablo-esq loot
  - loot drop locations are static, loot is random
  - 3 classic classes (loot based on class choice)
    - Warrior, Wizard, Ranger/Rogue types? If multiplayer, do we add Cleric as a fourth class?
  - muliplayer networked, co-op
  - top down 2d
  - track score(levels cleared, mobs killed, etc)
  - permanent death
  - difficult as rooms progress
  - as player increases in level. enemies grow in difficulty
  - equipment slots (no inventory)
  - loot 
* ???New Ideas???

*Questions that need answering*
- Real-time or Turn-based?
- Grid based movement or free move?
